<p>Functional health is often used as a complementary approach to traditional medicine. It is not meant to replace conventional medicine but to work alongside it to help patients achieve better overall health outcomes. By focusing on the root causes of health problems and addressing them with natural, non-invasive techniques, functional health can help patients achieve better health outcomes and improve their quality of life.</p>
