    <p>Sports has become incredibly demanding. Today, talent
        alone is not enough to be among the best. This requires
        huge amounts of work and many sacrifices. As a parent/guardian,
        you are the greatest mentor for your child. If you do not follow
        the advice you give yourself – your child probably won’t either.
        And you won’t be able to raise an elite athlete.

     <p>This session is for parents/guardian of athletes.</p>
