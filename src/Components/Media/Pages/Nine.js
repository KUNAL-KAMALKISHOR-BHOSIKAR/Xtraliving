  <h3>About Trouble in Murk town</h3>
  <p>Lord Myopic is determined to cover Murk town in fog, and take control of its people with his bottle-bottle screens. Only Professor Plano knows how to defeat him! On his way to the Crystal Clear Vision Academy, he accidentally ends up in the backyard of a certain pair of twins! Little does he know, this is the exact place he needs to be to succeed.</p>
 <p>1.5 billion people suffer from myopia, also known as short-sightedness. This number will rise to 5 billion by 2050, and 1 billion will develop high myopia, which can lead to blindness. Studies have shown that excessive smart device use is a key contributing factor. There has been a recent and dramatic increase in the amount of time that people spend on using smart devices, with each person spending an average of 6 hours each day using the internet on smart devices. This is equivalent to each person spending 2,190 hours or 3 months of every year, looking at device screens. Adding the amount of time people spend in school or work into the equation, it is therefore not surprising that a majority of people experience a sense that there is simply not enough time in the day. As people get too engrossed in their digital lives, most of them do not stop to monitor and calculate the amount of time that they spend on devices and do not realize how much of their lives they irreversibly waste on the cycle of internet and device addiction.</p>
